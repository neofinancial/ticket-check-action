# Pull Request Ticket Check Action

[![Build status](https://github.com/neofinancial/ticket-check-action/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/neofinancial/ticket-check-action/actions)

Verify that pull request titles start with a ticket ID

## Overview

This Github Action helps ensure that all pull requests have an associated ticket ID in their title.

It can detect the ID in the title of the pull request, in the branch name, whether a reference ID (`#123`) is in the body, or even if a full URL is in the body.

If no ticket/issue ID is in the title, it will extract the ID from the branch or body and update the title for you. It will fail the check if no ticket ID is found anywhere.

If a `ticketLink` input is provided and named groups `(?<ticketNumber>)` are used in regexes, a ticket link will be posted on a PR upon a successful match. This overrides the `quiet` option.

## Usage

In your `.github/workflows` folder, create a new `pull_request_linting.yml` file with the respective contents based on your needs.

The examples provided require some customizations unique to your codebase or issue tracking. If you're unfamiliar with building a regex, check out [Regexr](https://regexr.com/).

Make sure you check for the following to swap out with your values:

- `:owner` / `:org` - used in **all** examples
- `:repo` - used only in the GitHub example

## Releasing

### Publishing a release

To publish a release use the [Release](https://github.com/neofinancial/ticket-check-action/actions/workflows/release.yml) workflow. When you run the workflow it will ask you for a version tag like `v2.0.0`. This should be the full version number of the new release. It will also ask you for a major version number like `v2`. This allows you to reference the release as either `@v2` of `@v2.0.0`. You can also reference the hash of the release for additional security.

After the workflow runs a draft release will be created on GitHub. Edit the release and copy the CHANGELOG entries into the description. Then publish the release, including publishing to the GitHub Marketplace.

### Creating a preview Release

To create a preview release use the [Release Next](https://github.com/neofinancial/ticket-check-action/actions/workflows/release-next.yml) workflow. When you run the workflow it will ask you for the name of the branch to build. This should be the feature branch that you want to test. The release will be published to the `next` branch and you can use `neofinancial/ticket-check-action@next` in your workflows to test the preview release.
