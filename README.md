# Pull Request Ticket Check Action

[![Build status](https://github.com/neofinancial/ticket-check-action/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/neofinancial/ticket-check-action/actions)

Verify that pull request titles start with a ticket ID

## Overview

This Github Action helps ensure that all pull requests have an associated ticket ID in their title.

It can detect the ID in the title of the pull request, in the branch name, whether a reference ID (`#123`) is in the body, or even if a full URL is in the body.

If no ticket/issue ID is in the title, it will extract the ID from the branch or body and update the title for you. It will fail the check if no ticket ID is found anywhere.

## Usage

In your `.github/workflows` folder, create a new `pull_request_linting.yml` file with the respective contents based on your needs.

The examples provided require some customizations unique to your codebase or issue tracking. If you're unfamiliar with building a regex, check out [Regexr](https://regexr.com/).

Make sure you check for the following to swap out with your values:

- `:owner` / `:org` - used in **all** examples
- `:repo` - used only in the GitHub example

## Caveat

There is limitation currently in the way GitHub triggers their checks. If the pull request fails, a new commit is required (even as simple as an empty one `git commit -m "retrigger checks" --allow-empty` ) to flush the old statuses and re-run a new sequence of checks.
